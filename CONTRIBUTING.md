## How to contribute

### Open or claim an issue

#### Open an issue

Today we work off two main issue templates: _bug reports_ and _feature requests_.

_Bug reports_

Before creating a new bug report, please do two things:

1. If you want to report a bug you experienced while on a Daily call, try out these [troubleshooting tips](https://help.daily.co/en/articles/2303117-top-troubleshooting-tips) to see if that takes care of the bug.
2. If you're still seeing the error, check to see if somebody else has [already filed the issue](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-js/issues) before creating a new one.

If you've done those two things and need to create an issue, we'll ask you to tell us:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce the error
- Screenshots that illustrate where and what we should be looking for when we reproduce
- System information, like your device, OS, and browser
- Any additional context that you think could help us work through this

_Feature requests_

We're always happy to hear about new ways you'd like to use Daily. If you'd like a feature that we don't have yet, we'll ask you to let us know:

- If the feature will help you solve a particular problem
- Alternative solutions you've considered
- Any additional context that might help us understand this ask

#### Claim an issue

All issues labeled `good-first-issue` are up for grabs. If you'd like to tackle an existing issue, feel free to assign yourself, and please leave a comment letting everyone know that you're on it.

### Open a pull request

- If it's been a minute or if you haven't yet cloned, forked, or branched a repository, GitHub has some [docs to help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).
- When creating commit messages and pull request titles, please follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.
- Note that the `daily-js` repo is a public-facing mirror of an internal Daily repo, so when a pull request contribution is accepted, the pull request won't be merged in the tradtional way. But never fear! Your contributed commits _will_ appear, appropriately attributed to you, in the `daily-js` repo.
